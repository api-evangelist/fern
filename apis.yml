  Fern allows developers to instantly transform your OpenAPI into SDKs and Docs.
  Engineering teams build with Fern to offer a best-in-class developer
  experience. Stripe, Twilio, and AWS have the resources to invest in internal
  tooling for developer experience. They provide SDKs (aka client libraries) in
  multiple languages and developer documentation that stays up-to-date. We are
  building Fern to productize this process and make it accessible to all
  software companies.
